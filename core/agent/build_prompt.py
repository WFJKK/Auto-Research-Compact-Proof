"""Build the agent's prompt for a round from the template, the model folder and the archive.

Part 1, the same every round, comes from the model folder and the run config
alone: the module's source verbatim, the task's description and grouping, the
size settings, the recipe template with the helpers, the rules, the cost model
and the metric. Part 2 is rebuilt each round from the archive: the frontier per
size setting, the best recipes with their code, the agent's last attempts with
compact diagnostics, and its latest notes.

Information hygiene: the prompt never contains a string from the model's
hygiene list or the id of a held-out network. Part 1 holding one is an error in
the model folder; in Part 2 any that appears is replaced by "[removed]" and
counted. A test enforces both.
